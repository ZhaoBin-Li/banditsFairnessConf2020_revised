	Abstract = {A key problem in reinforcement learning is finding a good balance between the need to explore the environment and the need to gain rewards by exploiting existing knowledge. Much research has been devoted to this topic, and many of the proposed methods are aimed simply at ensuring that enough samples are gathered to estimate the value function well. In contrast, in 1959 Bellman proposed constructing a representation in which the states of the original system are paired with knowledge about the current model. Hence, knowledge about the possible Markov models of the environment is represented and maintained explicitly. Unfortunately, this approach is intractable except for bandit problems (where it gives rise to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method). In this paper, we explore ideas for making this method computationally tractable. We maintain a model of the environment as a Markov Decision Process. We sample finite-length trajectories from the infinite tree using ideas based on sparse sampling. Finding the values of the nodes of this sparse subtree can then be expressed as an optimization problem, which we solve using Linear Programming. We illustrate this approach on a few domains and compare it with other exploration algorithms.},

	Comment = {(private-note)Take a Bayesian approach to RL: incorporate model parameters in state. Represent as a beta distribution, fraction of times made different transitions. Hyperstate is the state, the current dynamics model counts, and the current reward model estimates. If take an action and transition to new state j, know how to update dynamics model and reward model counts. hyper-state MDP is an infinite tree of states, can express bellman equation over this. They maintain state-action values of original MDP using q-learning. Also compute values of hyperstates using linear programming. Linear program is as large as number of hyperstates considered. So they construct a sampled tree: sample using current estimates of action values to decide what to do, at each node use corresponding estimates of dynamics model to sample next node in trajectory, which was expanded to certain horizon. As go forward, in order to sample next action, either use value according to prior LP (if have that) for next hyperstate, or use state-action value estimate of MDP state. After build hyper tree then solve using linear programming. Have to decide whether to redo LP after each sample or only incrementally. Compared to q-learning and Wang's algorithm (similar). q-learning outperformed in some cases. In a 2x4 grid world they outperformed both: seemed strange q-learning was quite so bad, but may depend on alpha and epsilon value. would neat to try running this but probably not wort it.

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning promises a generic method for adapting agents to arbitrary tasks in arbitrary stochastic environments, but applying it to new real-world problems remains difficult, a few impressive success stories notwithstanding. Most interesting agent-environment systems have large state spaces, so performance depends crucially on efficient generalization from a small amount of experience. Current algorithms rely on model-free function approximation, which estimates the long-term values of states and actions directly from data and assumes that actions have similar values in similar states. This paper proposes model-based function approximation, which combines two forms of generalization by assuming that in addition to having similar values in similar states, actions also have similar effects. For one family of generalization schemes known as averagers, computation of an approximate value function from an approximate model is shown to be equivalent to the computation of the exact value function for a finite model derived from data. This derivation both integrates two independent sources of generalization and permits the extension of model-based techniques developed for finite problems. Preliminary experiments with a novel algorithm, AMBI (Approximate Models Based on Instances), demonstrate that this approach yields faster learning on some standard benchmark problems than many contemporary algorithms.},

Handles both absolute and relative dynamics. Combines this with fitted value iteration to create a complete model-based reinforcement learning. If there aren't enough samples "near" a new point, then use an optimistic approach (assume transition to high reward). This is true both for dynamics approximation (averager) and for value function approximator. They use a Gaussian weighting as the averager, but restrict it in practice to nearest 100 neighbours. Got good experimental results on mountain car and puddle world compared to some prior approaches. Using relative dynamics was important. Not clear how careful have to tune widths of Gaussians (basically how much can generalize between states). In theory the algorithm slows down as they get more instances, but they cap the number used to approximate the dynamics and then becomes a K nearest neighbours problem which can k log D time I think using a KD tree. No theoretical guarantees on how good result is or how many samples are needed into get good results. Know that solution will converge. As dimensionality of problem increases exponentially more data is required to explore each neighbourhood of state space.

	Abstract = {Agents often have to construct plans that obey resource limits for continuous resources whose consumption can only be characterized by probability distributions. While Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a state space of continuous and discrete variables are popular for modeling these domains, current algorithms for such MDPs can exhibit poor performance with a scale-up in their state space. To remedy that we propose an algorithm called DPFP. DPFP's key contribution is its exploitation of the dual space cumulative distribution functions. This dual formulation is key to DPFP's novel combination of three features. First, it enables DPFP's membership in a class of algorithms that perform forward search in a large (possibly infinite) policy space. Second, it provides  a new and efficient approach for varying the policy generation effort based on the likelihood of reaching different regions of the MDP state space. Third, it yields a bound on the error produced by such approximations. These three features conspire to allow DPFP's superior performance and systematic trade-off of optimality for speed. Our experimental evaluation shows that, when run stand-alone, DPFP outperforms other algorithms in terms of its any-time performance, whereas when run as a hybrid, it allows for a significant speedup of a leading continuous resource MDP solver.},

	Comment = {(private-note)Handles MDPs with a single continuous-state and a set of discrete states. Does a forward policy search in step function version of cumulative distribution functions: allows it to handle continuous duration domains. handles cycles by knowing that only a finite number of actions that can be taken since resource is monotonically decreasing. quality of approximation is bounded according to how finely discretize cdf (parameterized by k). F(p)(t)^pi is the probability of path p (s0... s) completing by time t under policy pi. Objective function is to find policy pi to max \Sum\_all paths p F(p)^pi R(s) aka to gain the max expected reward. After each integral the cdf is discretized into bins of height k. After doing this have to consider |A(s)|^ {F(so... s)]k] different policies for this cdf (each time probability jumps up, could do any one of actions possible there. These are called splittings. Number of splittings is ameliorated by two main things: the smaller the height of the cdf (aka chance of this path) the less splittings, and within a particular time interval, the lower the probability of transitioning to this state, the less number of policies that need to be considered. In the algorithm when the cdf < k then don't consider any policy: in effect if the likelihood of a path is too low, can ignore it in terms of choosing policy and estimating value function. This process is repeated for all possible F: this seems like it could be very expensive. Seems also that as increase the number of continuous variables the number of splits one's considering grows exponentially (though will have the same benefit of not considering multiple splits when probability not likely). On a rover problem (which was un/full/partially ordered) could get decent results very fast (by making a large k)-- much faster than lazy approx or CPH. But for longer runtimes CPH gave better solutions than DFPF. Created an interesting hybrid: uses DPFP to quickly find initial action to take from s0 and then uses this to narroww CPH's search. Got very good results: same quality as CPH and much faster. Not totally clear to me exactly how they did the hybrid: did they just fix the action to be taken in s0 at time t0 and then compute value exactly from then on? (Like fixing initial branch of tree)? Questions - How well would this work on multi-dimensional continuous-states? - Number of splittings could be large - Did they explore varying how to hybridize the two algorithms? }},

	Comment = {(private-note)A method for solving MDPs with a single monotonically decreasing continuous-state (time) and a set of discrete states. The authors use phase type distributions (sequences of exponential distributions) to approximate the dynamics. The authors then provide a piecewise linear combination of gamma representation of the value function. This representation stays in closed form for the integral over next states, the addition of the new reward function, and the max over actions, so it is a closed form backup. The summing over all next discrete states requires all the value functions have a set of common breakpoints. Taking the max over all actions also requires common breakpoints (between the Q value functions representing different actions: these breakpoints are a superset of all the original breakpoints plus whenever two gamma functions cross. The resulting value function is found by taking the dominant component for each. The number of breakpoints can increase exponentially during these steps. The authors provide a bound on the error incurred by stopping the value backups after N iterations compared to the optimal value function (since when distributions are converted to phase type distributions they may have self loops). Ultimately seems similar to Littman \& Boyan or Li \& Littman(2005) but allows a more flexible/compact dynamics representation for certain natural continuous distributions: demonstrate that this alone can help in problems with such dynamics (rather than approximating as PWC) but authors don't handle approximation issue. In small rover experiment (with deterministic discrete state transitions, which seems like it would reduce the number of breakpoints needed) if the dynamics are exponential they get a large benefit over lazy approximation. If the dynamics are Weibull or Normal still get ~ an order of magnitude improvement in amount of time to reach a given error. I wasn't quite clear how they were computing max norm error: was it by solving an exact version very precisely or running for a long time? Believe it was an empirical bound but might have just been bounds from two algorithms. Questions - What is the error induced by converting other distributions to phase type distributions, and how does the number of phases effect the quality of the approximation? - Would this method work if the continuous-time resource was not monotonically decreasing? - Could this be extending to multi-dimensional continuous states? - If merge together similar intervals, is there an error bound on resulting approximation? - If the distribution was PWC how would their method handle?},

	Comment = {(private-note)Two main contributions 1) Gives a formal set of criteria for determining if a MDP RL algorithm has a polynomial sample complexity (on all but a certain number of samples it will give an action that is epsilon close to optimal). These criteria were later used in Strehl and Littman (NIPS Dec 2007) and by us in CORL (UAI 2008). 2) Provides modifications of Rmax and interval based estimation to greatly reduce the computational complexity. Specifically, only does a single Bellman backup, at the specific state and action taken, in both algorithm instances. This reduces the computational complexity from O(SKA) (where K is the number of non-zero prob states that can be reached in a single step) to O(K ln(A)) where the ln(A) comes from using a priority queue. Essentially this is going from S^2 -> S and also reducing the action factor as well. They prove this reduction in computational complexity still allows the sample complexity to be the same as Rmax (O(S^2 A/ ( eps^3 (1-gamma)^6) ) when one ignores log factors. Experimentally they find that MBIE/Rmac gets better performance with fewer samples, but they required a lot more computational than RTDP-Rmax/RTDP-IE. In bandit-style MDP tried restricting the number of samples used to estimate the models (small) vs allowing a large number. In the small case then some difference between 4 but not huge. But if allowed a large number (which presumably improved performance? would've been nice to see this fleshed out a little more) then RTDP-Rmax/RTDP-IE had a significantly smaller number of backups compared to MBIE/Rmax. It would've been nice to see a total time comparison here to get a sense of the trade off of sample complexity vs computational complexity. This will admittedly be platform specific but perhaps there is a platform argument to be made here: that if actions take a long time then maybe sample complexity dominates. Interesting that even though their dynamics model is changing, they can still get good results. In continuous-state case, restricting to one backup doesn't help a lot because still considering a next state transition to an infinite set of states...},

We give a natural way of estimating the value of
all policies in these transformed POMDPs. Pol-

for a policy with high estimated value. We also

	Comment = {(private-note)Policy search algorithm which has a sample complexity that is polynomial in the horizon time. Converts stochastic transitions into deterministic, by assuming that a random sequence of numbers is provided. Can obtain a set of random numbers and use these to evaluate a bunch of different potential policies (now a transition is deterministic for a given action since the random number determines the transition chosen). They optimize the policy on this simulated deterministic model since this will have the same optima as the original model. Have some theoretical results on the number of scenarios (random number strings) necessary and show this is polynomial in the desired quantities in order to obtain a V(pi) that is epsilon close to the true V(pi). In some ways can be thought of as a way to keep a compact trajectory tree. However, they still have to evaluate the transitions for each policy separately. Also, still have to find right policy over this deterministic class. In their grid world experiment they do this by exhaustively enumerating all potential policies (|A|^|Z|) and checking result for each. In their bike experiment (with continuous states and actions) they first convert the rep to a vector, restrict the action function to be sigmoid of the features, and use (well in 1 version) gradient ascent to optimize the weights. They also use reward shaping, all of which suggests to me that this is a tricky problem. So challenges seem - Still have to optimize over a policy class. This could be very expensive and/or lead to local optima. Their theoretical bounds (I believe) hold for comparing the optimal value of V that can be obtained over a set of m random number vectors vs the value of V for the true policy. I dont believe they take into account any error by not being able to find the global optimal value for the given policy class due to inadequate optimization. LSPI states: "Policy search methods typically make a large number of relatively small steps of gradient-based policy updates to a parameterized policy function." Kakade states: "Though we have a concise representation of the tree we still have the computational cost of computing a transition..." (for a particular MDP ) "with a randomly initialized policy, then the number of calls to the generative model needed to obtain a non-zero gradient is still exponential in T. Hence the number of transitions we must compute is still exponential in T... Essentially PEGASUS is a variance reduction mechanism not a means to solve exploration." "In general the lower bound for the sparse sampling algorithm suggests that ... A^T is unavoidable (since there could be some leaf of the tree that we must discover in order to find our good policy..." His comment seems to argue that the number of m could be small but the number of policies to evaluate could be huge and so effectively to find a good one we have still made an exponential number of calls to the transition function},

	Abstract = {A critical issue for the application of Markov decision processes (MDPs) to realistic problems is how
the complexity of planning scales with the size of the MDP. In stochastic environments with very large or infinite
state spaces, traditional planning and reinforcement learning algorithms may be inapplicable, since their running
time typically grows linearly with the state space size in the worst case. In this paper we present a new algorithm
that, given only a generative model (a natural and common type of simulator) for an arbitrary MDP, performs
on-line, near-optimal planning with a per-state running time that has no dependence on the number of states. The
running time is exponential in the horizon time (which depends only on the discount factor γ and the desired
degree of approximation to the optimal policy). Our algorithm thus provides a different complexity trade-off than
classical algorithms such as value iteration---rather than scaling linearly in both horizon time and state space size,
our running time trades an exponential dependence on the former in exchange for no dependence on the latter.
Our algorithm is based on the idea of sparse sampling. We prove that a randomly sampled look-ahead tree that
covers only a vanishing fraction of the full look-ahead tree nevertheless suffices to compute near-optimal actions
from any state of an MDP. Practical implementations of the algorithm are discussed, and we draw ties to our related

This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution, taking into account not only the movement of the robot, but also the most recent observation.

@inproceedings{Toussaint2008Hierarchical,
	Abstract = {Planning can often be simplified by decomposing the task into smaller tasks arranged
hierarchically. Charlin et al. [4] recently
showed that the hierarchy discovery problem
can be framed as a non-convex optimization
problem. However, the inherent computa-
tional difficulty of solving such an optimization problem makes it hard to scale to real-world problems. In another line of research, Toussaint et al. [18] developed a method
to solve planning problems by maximum-
likelihood estimation. In this paper, we show how the hierarchy discovery problem in partially observable domains can be tackled using a similar maximum likelihood approach. Our technique first transforms the problem into a dynamic Bayesian network through which a hierarchical structure can naturally be discovered while optimizing the policy. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach scales better than previous techniques based on non-convex optimization.},

	Comment = {(private-note)Notes from UAI: solve POMDP using hierarchical finite state controller Charlin, Poupart et al did hierarchy discovery for POMDPs using quadratic optimization Known that can do linear time inerence in hierarchical HMMs (using exit states) mixture of processes that emits reward at final time slice EM: maximium likelihood corresponds to maximum expcted return only single forward and backward pass needed to do all DBNs Prefix the number of nodes per level (in the FSC) faster than their old approach \& similar in quality to HSVI Hierarchical controller better than flat (think flat overfit) factored controller better than hierarchical One issue is the EM only finds local min They have code available on Marc's webpage Questions If add fixed poitn to reward then it will rescale likelihood and change EM. They said they handle this using a special M step Stuart: why not do LP directly Poupart: can't do on original MDP, not linear. So instead go from quad -> graph -> LP My original notes: This paper takes a useful step towards autonomously finding hierarchical controllers to solve POMDP problems. Hierarchical controllers have been previously found to improve the efficiency of planning. In this paper the authors present an automatic way to induce the parameters of a hierarchical controller when given the number of levels and the number of nodes per level of the controller. Prior work by Toussaint demonstrated how one could represent the controller for a POMDP as a DBN with a special reward formulation, and solve for a good controller by using EM (which involved modifying the policy parameters). Other past work by Theocharous demonstrated how to convert a hierarchical POMDP to a DBN. In the current paper the authors unite these two ideas to show that a hierarchical finite state controller for a POMDP can be converted into a DBN, and then solved using techniques similar to Toussaint. This is an interesting paper and the promise of automatically finding the hierarchical structure of a controller is an important one. However, the paper would be much improved if the experimentalresults had been stronger. In particular, it would be helpful for the authors to compare to either state of the art POMDP solvers (such as HSVI) on the presented problems to demonstrate the benefit of hierarchical finite state controllers, or to solve a very large problem that could not be solved by existing techniques that lack hierarchy. In addition, the experimental results indicate that choosing the right number of nodes for each layer is critical in order for a good hierarchical controller to be found: though this is perhaps outside the scope of this paper, it is clear that structure search is a very interesting and key piece of future work. EM only finds a local minima, and this seems an important concern for some of these approaches. The error bars in table 2 are quite large, suggesting that often solutions vary significantly in their quality. Do the authors have ideas about how to tackle this issue further? Smaller points: - I believe that the authors should refer to Paskin and Murphy's NIPS 2001 paper for the citation about converting hierarchical HMM to DBNs rather than Theocharous et al[2004]. Theocharous et al. showed how to convert hierarchical POMDPs to DBNs (including a representation for the action node) but Paskin and Murphy were to my knowledge those responsible for first showing that HHMMs could be converted to DBNs (which was built on by Theocharous et al.). Therefore perhaps the authors should change 3.2 to refer to HPOMDPs rather than HHMMs, or else cite the alternate paper. - In section 4.1 there is no need to repeat all of the definitions for when the E variables are removed: just mention this initially and then do all definitions for the E variable removed. - How sensitive is the method to initialization? In particular, if the parameters c1,c2 and c3 are changed in section 4.2.1, does this significantly impact the results? - The greedy M-step (section 4.2.3) was very confusing. f did not appear to be defined: if it is defined earlier, please remind the reader, or else give an more clear example of the type of function f represents. A more detailed discussion would be very helpful in this section. Also I'm afraid that the steps taken to try to improve the chance of monotonic improvement were also not clear: what does adding c do? - If figure 4 could be moved to the same page where it is discussed, that would be helpful - It is hard to read the figures in the right hand side of table 2: perhaps the numbers could be made larger, or only a few could be presented. - A small table to compare the complexity of the various approaches, rather than discussing them in the text, would make it clearer to see the differences.},

The automorphism (of switching around the states) of all belief points and alpha-vectors are also in feasible good elements of the POMDP. in PBVI consider belief point with farthest distance: now they exclude redundant belief points by calc distance between all possible symmetric (under an automorphism) images of belief points. Also modify backup to include all symmetric images of alpha-vectors into alpha-vector set. Should check if automorphism is a mapping to self (b=f(b)) so don't add in additional alpha vectors here. Collected all beliefs then ran. Got a significant speedup compared to using standard PBVI on full set of beliefs (ones used in symmetric PBVI plus the symmetric ones of those). Did on fairly small problems so not sure how expensive it is to compute automorphisms as scale up to large state, action, observ state spaces, but I imagine it's not too bad.

	Comment = {Their error bounds relate the error between the optimal solution and HALP's solution to that of the optimal solution and the linear value function solution: but in general I don't see how one will know how a linear value function over a given set of bases approximates the true value function and so it seems like this error bound is not that helpful. They do show that using an exponential famiy basis leads to closed form expectation terms in the objective function and constraints (if use basis functions that are conjugate to transition function). They relax the HALP problem by assuming only a subset of the (infinite) constraints are satisfied. Argue that MC methods that sample constraints depend on sampling distribution and efficient distrib are hard to know in advance. Can compute an epsilon-grid discretization of continuous variables, but impractical for small epsilon and cannot be used for unbound state variables. Alternatively can do an incremental search for violated constraints. There are references related to each of these. Seems like in general, that's still a hard problem though maybe can get good empirical results. Tried rover problem and solved using an epsilon-grid (e=1/16) on the constraints. Problem has 10 discrete states and 2 continuous states (energy and time). Used bivariate normal basis functions uniformly spaced over grid to represent value function. Compared to discretizing state space (DV). With only 2x2 basis functions HALP got a better reward than 9x9 DV (though not clear that difference is statistically significant because huge std dev) and slightly faster. DV is significantly faster than HALP for same number of grid cells vs basis functions (aka 9x9 grid is 2 sec, 9x9 HALP is 560 sec). Quality of policy of HALP stays flat as increase number of components even if quality of value function approximation improves, which perhaps just argues that this problem requires a fairly simple policy. Seems like need more results to know how well this does (they argue they may be able to get several-fold speedup in HALP by considering basis func locality but not clear what that means). Overall to me the jury is out here as to whether HALP does better than discretizing on the rover problem: seems competitive but not necessarily better, and running time growth rate relative to number of basis functions seems much faster than in DV (which is bad). Also open question of choosing smart basis functions. What about comparing to a fitted value iteration approach? Could use a set of basis functions and just re-project onto each. Wonder how the speed and accuracy of this would compare to HALP. Not the same as discretizing everything, but instead just reproject at each time step.},

	Comment = {(private-note)Automatic variable resolution for continuous-state MDP problems. Goal is to handle continuous transition pdfs in continuous-state MDP problems with a finite set of actions. Rather than discretizing the transition dynamics a priori and then exactly solving the discretized problem, the authors only approximate on the fly as planning is computed ("lazy approximation"). Start by assuming transition functions are piecewise constants (PWC) and that the transition dynamics are relative (new state is a function of old state). Then if start with a PWC value function V0, then the order of V will increase (linear, quadratic, etc) with each backup (convolution with transition dynamics). Instead approximate V\_{n-1} by a a PWC function before backup (aka project value function down to a PWC representation before backup). Compute projection to try to minimize max norm error. The authors then say that a non-PWC transition function can be approximated by a PWC transition function (so still not directly working with Gaussians). This approximation is presumably only done once before any planning, so seems like this paper is less about working directly with Gaussians, and more about how to perform on the fly approximations by allowing the value function to grow slightly in complexity and then be re-projected to a simpler representation. In higher dimensions the backup convolution produces a function that is defined over a rectangular partition with a form such that the extreme values occur at the rectangular vertices (presumably just a linear function). Therefore to minimize the max norm error when projecting to a PWC rep, can just find the max and min values along each dimension and take the average: this computation can be done in O(4*number of dim) = O(number of dim). So they have a nice way to quickly optimally due the projection step. Their representation handles hybrid state spaces. Theoretical analysis: \varepsilon\_{n+1} = ||V\_{PWC,n+1}-V\_{n+1}||\_{\infty} = || V\_{PWC,n+1} - V\_{PWL,n+1}||\_{\infty} + \varepsilon\_{n}. So if keep the max norm of all the projections from PWL to PWC small, then overall error is small. In contrast, the error bound for pre-discretizing everything relies on the smoothness of V\_n in each grid cell so error\_{n+1} \leq smoothness\_n + error\_n. But apriori hard to know about V\_n smoothness so authors argue that LA allows user to automatically refine approximation as necessary in order to achieve small bounds. However, it seems like this will only hold if the transition function is PWC: if not (such as if it is Gaussian), then this is inducing another level of error not accounted for in the bounds. To control compactness they occasionally merge adjacent regions if values are close enough. This will alter bounds. LA is much faster than discretization at producing similar max norm errors. When discretize Gaussian transition functions, they argue that maybe should fix epsilon and increase number of components for trans model. Seems like won't know until try different levels of resolution of discretizing T. Also, even there comparing V using discretized T to V PWC so not ever comparing directly to error relative to true answer. Did try version of rover problem (not sure why they claimed so many discrete states, thought there were more like 10) and claimed good results when using a PWC transition rep of size 64. Didn't compare to discretized solution or say how many components there were for this state. Seems pretty different than result I remember: some features similar but not great approximation. Not clear that it's solved the issue of how to represent the transition models and whether that makes a difference: they could try different levels of representation at each backup and see which ends up with the smallest error, but this would be fairly inefficient. Would be nice to have way to do exact backup using Gaussian, and then project down, minimizing max norm error. Challenge is that much easier to max norm error on PWL functions. Confusions: need to go back through why convolution produces a quadratic value function. Don't understand why DP on discrete approximation can increase function size by res^number of dim= don't we know have a fixed representation of res^number of dim? Apparently not as in experiments since size of DM growing},

                  Model-based approaches to reinforcement learning
                  exhibit low sample complexity while learning nearly
                  optimal policies, but they are generally restricted
                  to finite domains.  Meanwhile, function
                  approximation addresses continuous state spaces but
                  typically weakens convergence guarantees.  In this
                  work, we develop a new algorithm that combines the
                  strengths of Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning,
                  which features instance-based state representation
                  and kernel-based function approximation, and
                  Prioritized Sweeping, which features model-based
                  exploration.  The resulting algorithm, Kernel-Based
                  Prioritized Sweeping, empirically converges to good
                  policies in continuous domains with relatively small
                  amounts of data.

                  For a robot, the ability to get from one place to
                  another is one of the most basic skills.  However,
                  locomotion on legged robots is a challenging
                  multidimensional control problem.  This paper
                  presents a machine learning approach to legged
                  locomotion, with all training done on the physical
                  robots.  The main contributions are a specification
                  of our fully automated learning environment and a
                  detailed empirical comparison of four different
                  machine learning algorithms for learning quadrupedal
                  locomotion.  The resulting learned walk is
                  considerably faster than all previously reported
                  hand-coded walks for the same robot platform.

	Abstract = {
                  Temporal-difference reinforcement learning (RL) has
                  been successfully applied in several domains with
                  large \emph{state} sets. Large \emph{action} sets,
                  however, have received considerably less attention.
                  This paper demonstrates the use of knowledge
                  transfer between related tasks to accelerate
                  learning with large action sets.  We introduce
                  \emph{action transfer}, a technique that extracts
                  the actions from the \mbox{(near-)optimal} solution
                  to the first task and uses them in place of the full
                  action set when learning any subsequent tasks.  When
                  optimal actions make up a small fraction of the
                  domain's action set, action transfer can
                  substantially reduce the number of actions and thus
                  the complexity of the problem. However, action
                  transfer between \emph{dissimilar} tasks can be
                  detrimental. To address this difficulty, we
                  contribute \emph{randomized task perturbation}
                  (RTP), an enhancement to action transfer that makes
                  it robust to unrepresentative source tasks. We
                  motivate RTP action transfer with a detailed
                  theoretical analysis featuring a formalism of
                  related tasks and a bound on the suboptimality of
                  action transfer.  The empirical results in this
                  paper show the potential of RTP action transfer to
                  substantially expand the applicability of RL to
                  problems with large action sets.

                  This paper presents a technique for the Simultaneous
                  Calibration of Action and Sensor Models (SCASM) on
                  a mobile robot.  While previous approaches to
                  calibration make use of an independent source of
                  feedback, SCASM is unsupervised, in that it does
                  not receive any well calibrated feedback about its
                  location.  Starting with only an inaccurate action
                  model, it learns accurate relative action and sensor
                  models.  Furthermore, SCASM is fully autonomous,
                  in that it operates with no human supervision.
                  SCASM is fully implemented and tested on a Sony

@inproceedings{Jong2007ModelBased,
	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning promises a generic method for adapting agents to arbitrary tasks in arbitrary stochastic environments, but applying it to new real-world problems remains difficult, a few impressive success stories notwithstanding. Most interesting agent-environment systems have large state spaces, so performance depends crucially on efficient generalization from a small amount of experience. Current algorithms rely on model-free function approximation, which estimates the long-term values of states and actions directly from data and assumes that actions have similar values in similar states. This paper proposes model-based function approximation, which combines two forms of generalization by assuming that in addition to having similar values in similar states, actions also have similar effects. For one family of generalization schemes known as averagers, computation of an approximate value function from an approximate model is shown to be equivalent to the computation of the exact value function for a finite model derived from data. This derivation both integrates two independent sources of generalization and permits the extension of model-based techniques developed for finite problems. Preliminary experiments with a novel algorithm, AMBI (Approximate Models Based on Instances), demonstrate that this approach yields faster learning on some standard benchmark problems than many contemporary algorithms.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new approach to the problem
of searching a space of policies for a Markov
decision process (MDP) or a partially observ-
able Markov decision process (POMDP), given
a model. Our approach is based on the following
observation: Any (PO)MDP can be transformed
into an ``equivalent'' POMDP in which all state
transitions (given the current state and action) are
deterministic. This reduces the general problem
of policy search to one in which we need only
consider POMDPs with deterministic transitions.
We give a natural way of estimating the value of
all policies in these transformed POMDPs. Pol-
icy search is then simply performed by searching
for a policy with high estimated value. We also
establish conditions under which our value esti-
mates will be good, recovering theoretical results
similar to those of Kearns, Mansour and Ng [7],
but with ``sample complexity'' bounds that have
only a polynomial rather than exponential depen-
dence on the horizon time. Our method applies
to arbitrary POMDPs, including ones with infinite state and action spaces. We also present
empirical results for our approach on a small discrete problem, and on a complex continuous state/continuous action problem involving learning to ride a bicycle.},

@inproceedings{Sontag2008Tightening,
	Abstract = {Linear Programming (LP) relaxations have
become powerful tools for finding the most
probable (MAP) configuration in graphical
models. These relaxations can be solved
efficiently using message-passing algorithms
such as belief propagation and, when the re-
laxation is tight, provably find the MAP con-
figuration. The standard LP relaxation is
not tight enough in many real-world prob-
lems, however, and this has lead to the use
of higher order cluster-based LP relaxations.
The computational cost increases exponen-
tially with the size of the clusters and lim-
its the number and type of clusters we can
use. We propose to solve the cluster selec-
tion problem monotonically in the dual LP,
iteratively selecting clusters with guaranteed
improvement, and quickly re-solving with the
added clusters by reusing the existing solu-
tion. Our dual message-passing algorithm
finds the MAP configuration in protein side-
chain placement, protein design, and stereo
problems, in cases where the standard LP re-
laxation fails.},

swing up. Moreover, we compare our results on this RL task to a nearly
optimal discrete DP solution in a fully known environment.},

We study the problem of planning in such domains and show how structured representations of the environment's dynamics can help partition the action space into a set of equivalence classes at run time. The partitioned action space is then used to produce a reduced set of actions. This technique speeds up search and can yield significant gains in planning efficiency. dramatically reduce the size of the search space, while pre-serving correctness and completeness of the planning algorithm. It can be combined with heuristic functions and other methods for improving planning speed.},

gently as quickly as possible in domains where finding a complete policy
would take a hopelessly long time. This approach, Relational Envelope-based Planning (R E B P) tackles large, noisy problems along two axes.
First, describing a domain as a relational MDP (instead of as an atomic or propositionally-factored MDP) allows problem structure and dynam-
ics to be captured compactly with a small set of probabilistic, relational rules. Second, an envelope-based approach to planning lets an agent begin acting quickly within a restricted part of the full state space and to  judiciously expand its envelope as resources permit.},

  abstract = 	 {The multi-armed bandit problem is a popular model for studying exploration/exploitation trade-off in sequential decision problems. Many algorithms are now available for this well-studied problem. One of the earliest algorithms, given by W. R. Thompson, dates back to 1933. This algorithm, referred to as Thompson Sampling, is a natural Bayesian algorithm. The basic idea is to choose an arm to play according to its probability of being the best arm. Thompson Sampling algorithm has experimentally been shown to be close to optimal. In addition, it is efficient to implement and exhibits several desirable properties such as small regret for delayed feedback. However, theoretical understanding of this algorithm was quite limited. In this paper, for the first time, we show that Thompson Sampling algorithm achieves logarithmic expected regret for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. More precisely, for the stochastic two-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time T is O(\frac\ln T∆ + \frac1∆^3). And, for the stochastic N-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time T is O(\left[\left(\sum_i=2^N \frac1\Delta_i^2\right)^2\right] \ln T). Our bounds are optimal but for the dependence on \Delta_i and the constant factors in big-Oh.}

  abstract = 	 {Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content optimization on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially sacrificing the experience of current users in order to gain information that will lead to better decisions in the future.  Recently, concerns have been raised about whether the process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much burden on certain individuals or groups.  Motivated by these concerns, we initiate the study of the externalities of exploration—the undesirable side effects that the presence of one party may impose on another—under the linear contextual bandits model.  We introduce the notion of a group externality, measuring the extent to which the presence of one population of users (the majority) impacts the rewards of another (the minority). We show that this impact can, in some cases, be negative, and that, in a certain sense, no algorithm can avoid it.  We then move on to study externalities at the individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as an externality imposed on the current user of a system by future users. This drives us to ask under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary.  We build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm that always chooses the action that currently looks optimal. We improve on prior results to show that a greedy approach almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold, and that this regret is at most $\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$. Returning to group-level effects, we show that under the same conditions, negative group externalities essentially vanish if one runs the greedy algorithm. Together, our results uncover a sharp contrast between the high externalities that exist in the worst case, and the ability to remove all externalities if the data is sufficiently diverse.}
